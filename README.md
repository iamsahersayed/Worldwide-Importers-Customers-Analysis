# Worldwide Importers SQL Analysis  
### Customer, Product & Sales Insights using SQL

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains an end-to-end **SQL business analysis** performed on the **Worldwide Importers (WWI)** database.  
The project focuses on answering realistic business questions related to **customer value, product performance, suppliers, delivery methods, inventory, and sales trends**.

Rather than only presenting final queries, this project documents the **full analytical process** — including initial drafts, mistakes, refinements, and the reasoning behind each SQL decision — to reflect how SQL is used in real-world analytical roles.
